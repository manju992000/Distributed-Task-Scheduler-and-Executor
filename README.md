# Distributed-Task-Scheduler-and-Executor
A distributed task scheduler and executor is a system designed to distribute tasks across multiple nodes (or threads in this case) and execute them concurrently. This kind of system can be useful in scenarios where there are many independent tasks to be processed in parallel, such as data processing, rendering, or simulation tasks.
